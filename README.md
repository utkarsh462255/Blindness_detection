Introduction
The Blindness Detection System is designed to analyze retinal images and identify patterns that might indicate the presence of eye diseases leading to blindness. This system could serve as an early screening tool for medical professionals to provide timely interventions.



Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blindness-detection.git
cd blindness-detection

Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Run the Detection System:
python detect_blindness.py --image path/to/retinal_image.jpg
This command will process the input retinal image and provide a diagnosis indicating the likelihood of blindness or visual impairment.

Advanced Usage:
The system also supports batch processing, custom model integration, and result visualization. Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions.

Features
Automated blindness detection using machine learning.
Support for various retinal image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
Configurable threshold for diagnosis sensitivity.
Batch processing for large datasets.
Integration of alternative machine learning models for experimentation.
